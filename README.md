# Human_Activity_Recognition_Using_Smartphones

This is a part of my project in class, machine learning, in Peking University.

The code for data preparing is written in Matlab, and the code for classification by SVM is in R.

Data can be found in [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions).
